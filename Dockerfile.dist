# Notes:
# Derive the version from the branch name with the "release-" prefix removed
# if it's present, e.g. in the branch "release-v0.1-alpha" the version will
# be "v0.1-alpha"
#
# If the branch doesn't start with release- then assume it's not a release
# branch and build just a single binary to save time and cpu cycles. If the
# branch is a release branch then build all the binaries in ${BUILD_LIST}.
#
# The normal way to get the branch name is this:
#   EC_GIT_BRANCH=$( git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD )
# but it doesn't work because the git-clone task checks out a sha directly
# rather than a branch. That's why we need to use `git for-each-ref`. Beware
# that testing this locally requires that you push the relevant branches to
# your 'origin' remote.
#
# Note that EC_GIT_ORIGIN_BRANCH, EC_GIT_BRANCH may be blank in a pre-merge PR
# because the PR branch refs are generally not present. In that case we'll use
# "_ci_build" as the version.
#
# For the EC_PATCH_NUM we assume there is a v0.2.0 (for example) tag created
# by a human. Using --merges there because we assume every build happens after
# a PR is merged.
