= ec fetch policy

Fetch policy rules from a git repository or other source

== Synopsis

Fetch policy rules (rego files) from a git repository or other source.

Each policy source will be downloaded into a separate unique directory inside
the "policy" directory under the destination directory specified. The
destination directory is either an automatically generated temporary work dir
if --work-dir is set, the directory specified with the --dest flag, or the
current directory if neither flag is specified.

This command is based on 'conftest pull' so you can refer to the conftest pull
documentation for more usage examples and for details on the different types of
supported source URLs.

Note that this command is not typically required to evaluate policies.
It has been made available for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.

== Examples
Fetching policies from multiple sources to a specific directory:

  ec fetch policy --dest fetched-policies \
	--source github.com/conforma/policy//policy/lib \
	--source github.com/conforma/policy//policy/release

Fetching policies and data from multiple sources to the current directory:

  ec fetch policy \
	--source github.com/conforma/policy//policy/lib \
	--source github.com/conforma/policy//policy/release \
	--data-source git::https://github.com/conforma/policy//example/data

Fetching policies from multiple sources to an automatically generated temporary
work directory:

  ec fetch policy --work-dir \
	--source github.com/conforma/policy//policy/lib \
	--source github.com/conforma/policy//policy/release

Different style url formats are supported. In this example "policy" is treated as
a subdirectory even without the go-getter style // delimiter:

  ec fetch policy --source https://github.com/conforma/policy/policy

Fetching policies from an OPA bundle (OCI image):

  ec fetch policy --source quay.io/enterprise-contract/ec-release-policy:latest

Notes:

- The --dest flag will be ignored if --work-dir is set
- Adding a protocol prefix such as 'git::' to the source url forces it to be treated
  as a go-getter style url.

== Options

--data-source:: data source url. multiple values are allowed (Default: [])
-d, --dest:: use the specified download destination directory. ignored if --work-dir is set (Default: .)
-h, --help:: help for policy (Default: false)
-s, --source:: policy source url. multiple values are allowed (Default: [])
-w, --work-dir:: use a temporary work dir as the download destination directory (Default: false)

== Options inherited from parent commands

--debug:: same as verbose but also show function names and line numbers (Default: false)
--kubeconfig:: path to the Kubernetes config file to use
--logfile:: file to write the logging output. If not specified logging output will be written to stderr
--quiet:: less verbose output (Default: false)
--timeout:: max overall execution duration (Default: 5m0s)
--trace:: enable trace logging, set one or more comma separated values: none,all,perf,cpu,mem,opa,log (Default: none)
