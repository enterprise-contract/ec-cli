= ec inspect policy

Read policies from source urls and show information about the rules inside them== Synopsis

Read policies from a source url and show information about the rules inside them.

This fetches policy sources similar to the 'ec fetch policy' command, but once
the policy is fetched the equivalent of 'opa inspect' is run against the
downloaded policies.

This can be used to extract information about each rule in the policy source,
including the rule annotations which include the rule's title and description
and custom fields used by ec to filter the results produced by conftest.

Note that this command is not typically required to verify the Enterprise
Contract. It has been made available for troubleshooting and debugging purposes.
