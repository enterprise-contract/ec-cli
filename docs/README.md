# ec CLI documentation

The content here is an [Antora][antora] component for the ec CLI. The YAML files
within the `reference` directory is generated by running `make docs` which
generates those based on the data structures of the Cobra[cobra] library used
for the command line argument parsing.

The `template` directory is used by the `reference-antora-extension` to
transform those YAML files into Asciidoc and is in Handlebars syntax, the
`modules/ROOT/nav.adoc` is also parsed and evaluated as a Handlebars template.

Look into `../website` on how to render the Antora website.
